# Elgg Multisite Documentation

[Elgg Multisite](https://elgg-multisite.com) is a tool that lets you run and manage 
multiple independent [Elgg](https://elgg.org) powered social networks off of a single 
installation of the code base. You can easily add, enable and disable sites, and even 
configure which plugins are available to each network independently.


## What can I do with it?

You can do everything that you can do with Elgg, but with the 
ability to create new networks on demand. This will for example 
let you:

* Set up your own version of Ning or Buddypress
* In your organisation or institution, easily set up Elgg 
  sites for each department.
* ... etc...

This is the canonical documentation for the project.
